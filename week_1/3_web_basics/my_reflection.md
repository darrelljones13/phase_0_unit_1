## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
	I learned the difference between web apps and websites.  Websites tend to be didactic and stationary, while web apps are dynamic and frequently changing.  I also learned (sort of) what happens when we call up a website.  We type the domain, which is just a name that represents an IP address which is retrieved from a DNS.  Once the DNS returns the IP address, we have access to the website.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
	You will need to use the proper tags for items you want to place in your website.  It will not load if your HTML code does not start with <html> and end with </html>. All code must begin with a <tag> and end with </tag>

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
	I was excited! Mostly because I set up my repository incorrectly the first time and got 404ed! 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	Github is starting to make sense to me now.  I had a hiccup with my repository and I had to troubleshoot creating a new one, which actually helped me understand how it works a little better.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	Not this time.  The Skillcrush and other resources were pretty straightforward.
