Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?
	I enjoyed taking the time to observe how these sites are designed.  I still feel slightly uncomfortable using CSS.  My blog is pretty hideous, but I'll figure this CSS thing out in time.
