## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
*   Once you are logged into GitHub.com, click the "+" drop-down-menu in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Click "Create New Repository" item from the menu.  Give the repository a name, description (optional), choose         public or private, and add any licenses.  Click "Create Repository." To clone a repository to your computer,          download, install, and log into the GitHub application. Click your username on the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.  Select a repository and click "Clone to Computer."  You now have a local version to work from.
* Describe what open source means
*   Open source means that any user can (depending on the license) edit, share, modify the source code of software.
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
*   Philosophically, I love the idea of open source.  A cost-free, collaboration of programmers curating the digital world is very exciting.  What makes me uneasy is there are malicious people out there that case use the concept of open source for identity theft, malware, adware, etc.
* Assess the importance of using licenses
*   Open source licenses are vital because they (in different ways) protect the creator and the work while maintaining the core tenets of the open source concept.  Having a clear understanding of the different licenses produces informed programmers who know exactly what their rights are.
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
*   I now have a relatively firm understanding of how to create repositories in GitHub.  I'm seemingly getting a feel for navigating GitHub and am beginning to understand why programmers like to use it.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
*   I was curious about Mozilla's overall philosophy regarding open source and vision of the internet.  I just quickly read through the Mozilla Manifesto. http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/ Interesting to see their approach to open source.
