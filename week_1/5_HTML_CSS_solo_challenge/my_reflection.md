## 5. [HTML/CSS Solo Challenge](5_HTML_CSS_solo_challenge/readme.md) Reflection

* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
	At the beginning, I wasn't sure what divs were or how they were used.  The GirlDevelopIt resources did a fine job of explaining what divs do and how to use the ids.
	
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
	I'm having trouble visualizing the placement of items on a page when using CSS.  I understand how to do it in HTML, but things start to get weird when I start altering the positions of elements in CSS.  Changing the margins and padding is tricky as well.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
	I love how sublime text puts in all the brackets and quotes for you.  It helps you not leave out a /> somewhere.  I feel like I now have a good understanding of the <div> tag after working through this challenge.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
	I feel like I have a decent understanding of HTML tags and what they do.  I struggled with CSS padding, borders, and margins.  I'm really having trouble envisioning where things are placed within the page.  My dbc2 page is a little disjointed, but I plan on going back and fixing.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
	Since these are just exercises, I tried to have some fun with the content.  How often do you get to make a page about vegetables? I enjoy the HTML coding, the CSS is much more challenging for me.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	Repeatedly committing new changes in github just to see if one tweak to the code fixed a problem.
