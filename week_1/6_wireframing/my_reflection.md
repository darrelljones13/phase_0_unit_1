## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
	As a former designer, I am familiar with the design thinking process. It is great to see it being applied in other aspects of the business world.  Reading the perspectives of professionals in the field was helpful, especially how they had to adapt the model to fit certain philosophies and infrastructure of each company.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	I love this stuff.  being a visual learner, this is right in my wheelhouse. I'm looking forward to going back to my dbc1.html page and re-designing using wireframes.

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  	
	Initially I wasn't sure how the wireframing would work. I found Wirify, and it made the task so much easier.
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what? 
	I still need a little more time with CSS and the layout and positioning elements.  Wireframing and establishing a grid should help with that.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
	I would count Wirify as a nice shortcut to use when wireframing existing sites.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
	For the first time this week, I would say I feel pretty confident about this one.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
	I enjoyed the research part of this lesson. I appreciated looking into current perspectives on Design Thinking.
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
	None
