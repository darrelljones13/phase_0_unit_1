Hi all,

Darrell Jones here.  I'm originally from Pittsburgh, PA but currently living in Chicago.  My learning style is Visual/Kinesthetic if I remember correctly.  I've done some HTML and Actionscript years ago but for the most part, I am pretty new at this.  

My favorite sites are:
baseballamerica.com
zergnet.com
amazon.com


Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I'm not certain where to find others' responses, but here is mine:
	I was very excited to start phase 0 this week.  I was almost instantly overwhelmed by almost everything (methods of communication, requirements, workload, etc).  I was mostly worried that I didn't know enough to complete the assignments correctly.  As the week has gone on, I've become more comfortable with the requirements and I learned during my intro session that feeling overwhelmed was okay. That we are assessed based on our efforts and not having everything perfect was reassuring.  For me the effort is there, the skills just aren't honed yet.  I'm most looking forward to phase 1 and learning in-person.
