## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't?
	HTML seems logical and straightforward. Everything is nested within.  I haven't memorized all of the tags and therefore I'm not entire sure what it is capable of doing. 

* What seems good and bad about HTML?
	The straightforwardness of the code seems to be a good thing.  You can go from top to bottom and visualize the page.  The bad might be that it gets a little cluttered in the lines of code.  A site with a lot of content can be difficult to navigate. But I'm relatively new at this so I'm not even sure if that is a bad thing or not.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	Externally linking the CSS stylesheet makes a lot of sense and seems to be an efficient way of changing the overall design of the website.  

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I spent a lot of time using the Mozilla CSS tutorial, which is extensive.  It seems to have everything a beginner would need.  I spent so much time using it, that I didn't look elsewhere for resources.
