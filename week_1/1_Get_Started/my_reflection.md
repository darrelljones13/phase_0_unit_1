## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* In setting up Git, I had a little trouble adding SSH keys (as instructed in the GirlDevelopIt presentation) and still a little unsure of what these keys do.  In the process I learned that changes aren't finalized until a commit is made.
* To a non-technical audience, I'd describe git as a way to track changes within any project locally without having to keep saving multiple versions.  GitHub allows multiple users to work remotely to add to the original base file. Git is local, while GitHub is remote.
* Version control is a way to organize and keep track of files and the changes made to those files.  GitHub helps keep track of changes by showing who made changes to the file and when they made the changes.  GitHub allows multiple users to work on the same file at once by merging.
* I've learned that using version control makes sense for developers because it allows multiple collaborators to make edits without overwriting the original.  This allows anyone to go back and work on an earlier version.
* While I do have a much better understanding of version control and its benefits, I'm still not entirely sure how to navigate Git and GitHub.  Especially how to create and access repositories.  I'd imagine we'll be working on that task soon enough.
