# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
	I think web standards are a good thing.  They provide a structure to provide access to all people.  What I like most is that they are not static.  Standards are dynamic and ever evolving as the web itself evolves.  

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
	It makes sense for the most part.  W3C upholds the standards in the context of accessibility, internationality, and use with all web-enabled devices.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
	I do like HTML5 elements!  It seems much more intuitive than creating so many divs.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	It paves the way for consistency across browsers as it forces all browsers to reset to default styles.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	Chrome, Safari, Firefox.  As I'm currently learning to design these sites, some consistency would be helpful.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	http://www.w3.org/ helped me grasp web standards, and a few youtube videos helped me better understand how section jumps (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNlsuVorDQs) and to use @font-face (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQsAHJN0rZE)
