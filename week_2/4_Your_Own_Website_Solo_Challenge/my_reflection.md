# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://darrelljones13.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
	I learned that many sites nowadays are developed based on UX.  Web content is now created with the end user in mind, and not solely on the design desires of the client.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
	I do like thinking about the end user and how they would navigate my site.  I simply do not have enough content at the moment to really put these ideas to work.  As we move through phase 0, our sites have the potential of becoming cluttered.  Now that I have a good grasp of UX, I have the background to prevent this from happening.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
	I sketched out my wireframed site on paper and stayed true to that design for the most part.  I still have issues with positioning elements in CSS and need more practice.  Visually, my site isn't up to my standards.  If I have time after completing the remaining modules, I will go back and work on this.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
	I actually like the simplicity at the moment, but I might add some interesting graphical elements next time.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
	As I mentioned, I still struggle with positioning in CSS.  The Chrome Developer Tools have certainly helped with these struggles, but I still need more practice.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
