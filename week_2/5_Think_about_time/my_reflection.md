# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
	I've always been  big on looking and planning ahead with long term projects.  This helps me identify potential scheduling obstacles down the road.  I will be working 40+hours per week until June13th. With Phase 0, I knew there would be few weeks where I had major work commitments on the weekends or evenings.  This week was one of them.  I had to prepare for and facilitate a teacher training all day on May 3rd.  This carved a huge chunk of spare time out of my schedule intended for phase 0 work.  I was able to get through all of the material and my first GPS, but I did not have a chance to peer pair this week. I'm hoping to correct that next week.  I have one more of these teacher training seminars to conduct on May 14th before I begin transitioning out of my position.  

	The other issue I have is that I am a complete newbie to all of this and I feel it necessary to read every resource in each module.  I feel if I don't I will not be able to grasp the concepts.  I planned for 10-15 hours per week in phase 0 and thus far, have spent well of 20 hours each week.

* How will you combat that? 
	Since May 14th is a Wednesday, I will try and get through as much material on Monday and Tuesday evening.  Maria has been posting the next week's work before Sunday and I'm hoping to get through the previous week's work early so I can begin on the next module.  

* What techniques will you try?
	When I've gotten stuck on something, I've taken a walk, played with my dog, or have gone to the gym.  Taking a break away from the screen and doing something physical has really helped me refocus my thoughts.  I plan to keep doing this.  I'd also like to work on getting in the zone.  I feel like I can do most of the items in the "How to Achieve the Creative State of Flow" except for the concentration bit.  I find it difficult to get into the mindset when I'm thinking of a million other things.

	I need to discover ways to clear my mind.  Meditation perhaps.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
	My plan has been to get as much of the work done early in the week.  I absolutely hate waiting until the day of to complete the work.  It goes against every fiber of my being.  I plan to keep trying this strategy.
