# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
	Responsive Design is the process of creating code within HTML and CSS to automatically size a website according to browser.  It is absolutely best practice because it prevents your layout from looking off within certain browsers and it doesn't put off potential users by having them scroll horizontally to access content.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	They have created a more portable way of accessing web content. Nowadays, users access websites via smartphones and tablets just as often as they do on a desktop/ laptop computer. Developers have responded to these changes by using responsive design, tailoring their sites to adjust to multiple browser sizes.  In the future, I could see browsers without border contstraints.  Instead of touchscreens, websites could be projected 2D or 3D with users accessing content within space.  That sounds a little out there, but I keep thinking of the interfaces Tony Stark uses.  Why couldn't we do that with the internet?

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
	Visually impaired people certainly can use the web and we should design accordingly. They can access content using screen reader software.  GirlDevelopIt says it best.  Good design practice should allow for accessibility as a side-effect.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
	Responsive Design is a concept I had not heard of before, but it just makes so much sense.  Why wouldn't you want to optimize your site for anyone who might be accessing it? One thing that still doesn't make sense to me is where Javascript fits into all of this.  Does it work in tandem with HTML and CSS or does it stand alone?  

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
