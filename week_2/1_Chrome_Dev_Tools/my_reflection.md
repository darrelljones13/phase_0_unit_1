# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
	DOMs are essentially trees of objects(nodes) that are nested inside a logical hierarchy.  It makes sense to me because of the foundation of knowledge that was laid during week 1.  Everything we created fit nicely into this structure.  What is great about it is that it seems to make editing easier. I haven't seen a downside yet.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
	At first glance, you can see just how much more styling wordpress has.  I have only a few CSS items on my page (I intend to add more). I also noticed that wordpress's CSS file has a lot of individual words or phrases separated by commas in almost every major section. Here is an example:
		body, div, span, applet, object, iframe, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre, a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code, del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp, small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var, b, u, i, center, dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li, fieldset, form, label, legend, table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td, article, aside, canvas, details, embed, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section, summary, mark, audio, video 
	I'm uncertain what this means, though I do see many HTML tags that I recognize within.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
	Last week, I really struggled with layout and positioning in CSS.  By editing and instantly seeing the effect, I was able to better grasp how to use CSS. I love that you can make changes right there.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	In addition so some CSS aha moments, using Chrome Dev Tools helped me better understand load times for objects and learned a little bit about Javascript in the process.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I found a couple of Youtube videos that helped me visualize how CSS affects the placement of objects.
