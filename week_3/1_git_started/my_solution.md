## Release 5: Reflection

Learning to use Git was incredibly challenging for me.  I have been trying out commands the last few weeks attempting to get more comfortable using them in the terminal.  I've come a long way in my overall understanding of using the commands.  The LearnGitBranching resource helped me visualize what is happening when I clone/push/pull/merge etc.  I'm still not entirely certain what is happening when I actually do it.  I've been testing out commands and seeing what happens and so far, I haven't ruined anything.  I keep pushing myself to use the terminal even though the GitHub app is pretty amazing and straightforward.
